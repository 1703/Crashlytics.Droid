Crashlytics binding project for Android

Crashlytics does not support Xamarin.Android nor does it provides a binding project that we can use with our project.

I've developed this binding project trying to solve this problem.

Any help is appreciated!

PS:
THe JAR files were taken from the public Crashlytics files from this URL:
https://twittersdk.artifactoryonline.com/twittersdk/public/

Actually there are no JAR files there, only ARR, but there is no aparent reason for this, so I extracted the JAR files from each of the ARR files and made the binding project.
